The original code is from the book Web Development with MongoDB and Node.js. 
I originally went through this text and built this site alongside the book. 
Since originally reading this book, I feel as though my node and mongo skills have
improved greatly, so I am going to take a chance to improve this project.

To start make sure you have an instance of Mongod running then type 'node server.js'
into your terminal. 

Open your browser to localhost:3300
